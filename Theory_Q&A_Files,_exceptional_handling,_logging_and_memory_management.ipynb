        "Q.1 What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- While interpreted languages translate and run code line-by-line during execution (slower, more portable), requiring an interpreter on each system, compiled languages translate all code to machine code before running (faster execution, platform-specific); compiled code produces executables, whereas interpreted code uses source files, offering faster development but slower runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 What is exception handling in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's exception handling feature allows a program to smoothly accept unforeseen circumstances without crashing by managing runtime errors, or exceptions. Python offers an organized method to identify the issue, address it, and carry on with the program's flow rather than abruptly halting execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "- The finally block in exception handling guarantees that critical cleanup code, like closing files, database connections, or network sockets, always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred, was caught, or even if return, break, or continue statements are used. Its main purpose is to prevent resource leaks and ensure program stability by performing necessary resource deallocation and final tasks, making code robust and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4 What is logging in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, logging is the process of documenting messages and events that take place while a program is running in order to supply crucial runtime data for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python classes, the __del__ method—also referred to as the destructor—is a unique method that is called when a class instance is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- The import statement is used to import a module or a module's attribute into the current namespace. It allows you to access the module's attributes by prefixing them with the module name. On the other hand, the from statement is used to import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. With the from statement, you can import only the attributes that you need, instead of the entire module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python allows you to handle numerous exceptions by either using multiple specialized except clauses or a single except block with a tuple of exception types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's with statement makes exception handling easier by guaranteeing that cleanup operations are carried out regardless of how the nested block ends. Its main function while managing files is to offer a reliable, \"safe\" method of opening and closing files automatically, even in the event of failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "- While multiprocessing runs independent processes with their own memory (good for CPU-intensive tasks) and uses multiple CPU cores for true parallelism, multithreading runs multiple tasks (threads) within a single process, sharing memory for efficiency (good for I/O tasks). Processes are heavyweight and threads are lightweight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "\n",
        "- One way to monitor events that occur during software execution is by logging. Software development, debugging, and operation all depend on logging. You have very little possibility of identifying the root of the issue if your software fails and you don't have any logging records. It will take a lot of time to find the cause. If something goes wrong, you can use logging to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so we can figure out what went wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11 What is memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's memory management is an automatic procedure that manages memory allocation and deallocation for all Python objects, freeing developers to concentrate on coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12 What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's exception handling technique uses try and except blocks to gracefully handle runtime faults and keep a program from crashing. It enables programmers to identify issues, address them with particular reasoning, and guarantee the application keeps running. The fundamental structure involves placing the code that might raise an exception within a try block and the code to handle the exception within an except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13 Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python memory management is important because it makes effective use of the limited system memory, preventing program crashes, preventing performance deterioration (memory leaks), and ensuring the application can scale and function properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14 What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "- You may check a block of code for mistakes with the try block. You can handle the mistake using the except block. When there is no error, you can run code using the else block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15 How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's garbage collection system in the standard CPython interpreter is an automatic memory management process that uses a combination of two primary strategies: reference counting and a supplementary generational garbage collector. This combination is designed to efficiently reclaim memory without requiring manual intervention from the developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16 What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "\n",
        "- When using try...except...else...finally in Python for exception management, the else block is only run if the function inside the try block executes without raising any exceptions [1].\n",
        "Its main goal is to promote simpler, easier-to-read code by separating code that should only execute when no errors occur from code that could create an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17  What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Python logging module provides five primary built-in logging levels mentioned below:\n",
        "\n",

        "Q.18 What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- The multiprocessing module offers a higher-level, cross-platform API for managing processes in a manner more in line with common Python programming paradigms like threads, whereas os.fork() is a lower-level, Unix-specific function for process generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19 What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, closing a file is essential because it releases system resources, guarantees data integrity, and can stop possible data corruption or program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20 What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- The primary difference between the Python methods file.read() and file.readline() lies in how much data they retrieve from a file:\n",
        "file.read() reads the entire content of a file into a single string by default.\n",
        "file.readline() reads only a single line of text from the file until it encounters a newline character (\\n) or the end of the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.21 What is the logging module in Python used for.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Debugging, monitoring, and analyzing application behavior all depend on the Python logging module, a built-in standard library for tracking events that happen while software is operating.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.22  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "- In file handling, the os module in Python is mainly used to communicate with the operating system itself rather than the contents of a file. It offers a means of utilizing operating system-dependent capabilities. This covers path manipulation, file and directory management, and obtaining information about them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.23 What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's automated nature and underlying techniques like the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can cause performance problems, memory bloat, and unanticipated memory retention, are the main causes of memory management's difficulties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.24 How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python raise Keyword is used to raise exceptions or errors. The raise keyword raises an error and stops the control flow of the program. It is used to bring up the current exception in an exception handler so that it can be handled further up the call stack.\n",
        "\n",
