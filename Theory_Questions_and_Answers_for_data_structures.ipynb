        "Q.4\tDescribe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data is stored in an unordered collection of distinct key-value pairs in Python dictionaries. With the help of their corresponding keys, this structure makes it possible to retrieve values quickly. For example every item in a dictionary has a key and a matching value. The value can be found and accessed using the key. Dictionary keys have to be distinct. The value linked to an existing key will be updated with the new value if you attempt to add a new key-value pair. Any sort of data, including mutable types like lists, other dictionaries, or custom objects, can be used as values in a dictionary.\n",

        "Q.5\tWhy might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",

        "Q,6\tWhat is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
        "\n",
        "- A string is an unchangeable string of characters used to represent text in Python. Single quotes ('...'), double quotes (\"...\"), or triple quotes (\"...\") for multi-line strings are used to define strings and main difference is that Strings are immutable, which means once a string is created, its individual characters cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.\n",
        "In contrast, a list is an ordered, modifiable series of elements that can include any kind of data. Lists are defined by separating items with commas and enclosing them in square brackets ([...]). Also Lists are mutable, which means elements within a list can be added, removed, or modified after the list has been created.\n",

        "Q.7\tHow do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "a.\tPrevents Unintentional Changes: Preventing unintentional changes to data is the biggest advantage. If you have a set of values (such coordinates, configuration settings, or database entries) that should not change while your program runs, keeping them in a tuple ensures that other portions of your code won't inadvertently alter them.\n",
        "\n",
        "b.\tEnsures Data Consistency: Tuples offer a viable method in situations when data must be constant and dependable. For example, employing a tuple guarantees that an object's fixed set of attributes will always retain their original values.\n",

In order to find the matching values in an underlying array or other comparable structure, it employs a hash function to translate keys into numerical indices. Python's built-in “dict” data type is an implementation of a hash table. When you create a dictionary in Python, you are essentially creating a hash table.\n",

        "\n",
        "b.\tHashing: A hash value is produced by passing the key through an internal hash function when a key-value pair is added to a Python dictionary. The location of the key-value pair in memory is then decided using this hash value.\n",
        "\n",
        "c.\tQuick Lookups: It is particularly effective to retrieve values from a Python dictionary since keys are hashed to specific locations. Using the hash of the value's key, the dictionary may determine the value's likely position without having to go through every element.\n",
        "\n",
        "d.\tHashable Keys: A key must be \"hashable\" in order to be utilized in a Python dictionary and, consequently, in a hash table. This implies that the hash value of the key must remain constant during its lifespan and be unchangeable.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Python strings are immutable —that is, once they are formed, they cannot be altered. We create new strings as we go to represent computed values because strings cannot be altered. For instance, the expression ('hello' + 'Rohan') creates the new string \"helloRohan\" by combining the two strings \"hello\" and \"Rohan.\"\n",

        "Q.11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need to retrieve an item by a specific identifier (key) rather than its position, dictionaries are more effective for lookups and provide faster data retrieval. Additionally, they offer a more readable and organized method of storing related or complex data using key-value pairs, which is more user-friendly than looking for a particular item in a list. One more advantage is that Dictionaries are far more effective than lists for dealing with vast volumes of data if you regularly need to search, add, or remove entries.\n",

For example Python does a sequential search when we use “in” with a list and until it discovers a match or reaches the end of the list, it iterates through each item in the list starting at the beginning. Whereas Python looks for a key, not a value, when utilizing in with a dictionary. Hash tables are used to implement dictionaries, enabling extremely effective lookups. Python computes a hash value for the key being searched and goes straight to the matching place in the hash table rather than iterating through every element.\n",

As The elements of a tuple are fixed in memory at the time of creation. Any attempt to add, modify, or remove an element from an already-existing tuple will cause a TypeError. Although a tuple's elements cannot be changed directly, you can accomplish a similar result by making a new tuple with the appropriate modifications. This frequently entails changing the tuple to a list, performing the necessary changes, and then changing it back to a tuple. Nevertheless, this procedure does not change the existing tuple object; instead, it generates a new one.\n",
